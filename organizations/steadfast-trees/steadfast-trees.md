## History

The Steadfast Trees refer to themselves and their island under a shared name, indicating the deep bond they have to the land. The name is derived from the cluster of gigantic trees that tower overhead and fill most of the island, creating dense jungles everywhere beyond the sandy beaches. Tabaxi who reside on this island use its name as their surnames as long as they reside within the space, but any who develop wanderlust and explore beyond the Steadfast Trees are granted new names during a tribal naming ceremony.
