# Energy Canisters

These canisters have been infused with charged batteries which can channel their energy into a weapon built to accept the cartridges. As a Bonus Action, a creature wielding one of these weapons can load that weapon with a canister. While a canister is loaded, each attack from its weapon changes its damage type to that of the canister, at the cost of one charge per hit. This damage is not considered magical, unless the weapon itself is a magic item.
